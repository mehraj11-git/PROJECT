Hello Everyone!

This is my first projectâ€”a text editor. While it was initially challenging, I began to enjoy it more as I progressed
### **How I Started My Text Editor Project**

1. **Inspiration:**
   I was inspired to create a text editor after realizing how many simple text editors were available. 
2. **Research:**
   Before diving in, I spent some time researching existing text editors and their functionalities. I explored several tutorials and documentation.
3. **Planning:**
   I outlined the essential features I wanted to include, such as file saving, text formatting, and user-friendly design. This helped me create a roadmap for my development process.
4. **Setup:**
   I decided to use Python for its simplicity and versatility. I also chose libraries or tools e.g., Tkinter for the GUI] to facilitate the development process.
5. **Development:**
   I started by implementing the core functionality, allowing users to input and edit text. Gradually, I added more features like [colour theme ,view bar], which made the project more engaging.
6. **Challenges:**
   Initially, I faced challenges with the functionality of the dropdown of the menu bar. However, through online forums and documentation, I found solutions and moved past these hurdles.
7. **Learning and Enjoyment:**
   Throughout the development, I learned a lot about Python and software development practices. As I progressed, I began to enjoy the process more and more, especially when I saw the text editor come to life.

8. **Future Improvements:**
   Moving forward, I plan to enhance the text editor by adding features like [more forms of paragraph, different types of font and styles].

----STEPONE----MAIN MENU--------

In this first step, we won't be using the `grid` or `pack` methods to create the menu. Instead, we'll use the `config` method. 

We'll start by creating the "File" menu. While setting it up, we will use the `tearoff` option, as we don't want the "File" menu commands to be detachable, so we'll set `tearoff=False`.

After creating the menu, we need to add it to the main menu using the `cascade` method. If we don't do this, the "File" menu won't be displayed. The `cascade` method requires a `label` for the menu (like "File") and the menu details that specify what commands it contains.
